# TheMovieDB_ActorSearch
Summary:
The application uses the TheMovieDB API and calls first page of the actors. These actor names are listed and every cell contains a name, a photograph and popularity of an actor. Secondly, there is search bar at the top of the page and it searches word is searched as prefix in actor names. In the search bar, number of results is shown.

Search Bar:
There is a two way to work on search bar. One of them is the word is written and searching is started by a "search button" and other way is that searching is working while writing the word without a button. I used second way because this way is more modern and user friendly.
