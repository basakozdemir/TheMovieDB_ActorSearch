# TheMovieDB_ActorSearch
Summary:

The application uses the TheMovieDB API and calls the first page of the actors. These actor names are listed and every cell contains a name, a photograph, and popularity of an actor. Secondly, there is a search bar at the top of the page and it searches word is searched as the prefix in actor names. In the search bar, the number of results is shown.



Search Bar:

There is two way to work in the search bar. One of them is the word is written and searching is started by a "search button" and another way is that searching is working while writing the word without a button. I used the second way because this way is more modern and user-friendly.
